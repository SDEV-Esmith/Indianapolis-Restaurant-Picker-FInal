This program allows a user to choose from 3 price tiers($5 - $15, $15 - $25, $50 - $100) and depending on the
choice it displays a random restaurant and image for the user. It starts with a welcome screen and once the
start button is clicked the user can then choose a price tier. The user can click the "back" button to choose a different price tier,
try another random restaurant in the same price tier with "try again" button, and the "end" button when the user
is satisfied with their choice. Once end is clicked the main window is hidden and a second window pops up thanking the
user and displaying their final restaurant and an exit button to close the program.
